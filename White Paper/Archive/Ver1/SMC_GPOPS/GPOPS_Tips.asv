Tips for running GPOPS

Use batch() when you want to use MATLAB while GPOPS is running:
This doesn't display the output, but there must be a way to do so

Start matlabpool with a number of "labs" (lab = core?)
matlabpool open 4

job = batch('script')

wait(job)

load(job)

destroy(job)

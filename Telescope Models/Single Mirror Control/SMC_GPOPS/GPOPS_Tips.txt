Tips for running GPOPS

Use batch() when you want to use MATLAB while GPOPS is running:
This doesn't display the output, but there must be a way to do so

Start matlabpool with a number of "labs" (lab = core?)
matlabpool open 4

create object and start script.m
job = batch('script')

when you think it is done, or close use wait to recognize. This will not 
allow you to enter commands anymore
wait(job)

when you know it is done, load the data
load(job)

when you are done with the data, destroy the object
destroy(job)

#1 - Compute the FRFs from the data using frequency domain techniques (Lab #3). Measurement type can be determined from the FRF plots because there will be a phase shift of 90 deg (?) for each derivative.

#2 - The damping and spring constants can be found from the natural frequencies and damping ratios which can be found from the measured data.

#3 - I assume the input is a force

#4 - Initial conditions are not necessary for frequency analysis

#5 - Clean up the FRFs by averaging

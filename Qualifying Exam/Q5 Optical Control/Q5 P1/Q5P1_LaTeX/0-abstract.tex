Consider a two-dimensional segment of a (parabolic) mirror as indicated in Figure~\ref{sys}. The upper and lower corners are each supported by both a vertical and horizontal stiffening unit, $S$, of identical design (see Figure~\ref{stiff}). Additionally, the upper corner has displacement control units (not shown) while the lower corner is exposed to an initial random disturbance. With no active control, characterize the evolution of the focal point distribution when subjected to random disturbance.

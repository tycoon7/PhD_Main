%% If you prefer to provide "acknowledgements" instead (note the added "e"
%% between the "g" and the "m") then add the "e" in the macro name so that
%% it reads "\acknowledgements".}

%% There is a predefined list of symbols that can be generated from symbols
%% marked in the text by "\addsymbol{Definition}{Symbol}".  If the symbols are
%% too wide for the table, the allotted width can be increased by including
%% an optional width in square brackets, as in  "\listofsymbols[.3in]".  
%% Similarly, a list of abbreviations is possible, corresponding to
%% "\addabbrev{Definition}{Symbol}".  Both of these lists will be ordered by 
%% number.

%% Additional "lists" can be added to the end of the front matter using the
%% \addlistof macro.  For example:
%\addlistof{Symbols}{Insert your list of symbols here or comment out this line.}
%% Note that the command "\input{symbols}" can be used if the symbol list is
%% contained in a separate file called "symbols.tex"}  In this example, the 
%% symbol list is assumed to be generated manually or using some other package

\addlistof{Acronyms}{\input{acronyms}}
%% Use "\input{acronyms}" if the acronym list is in a separate file called
%% "acronyms.tex".  Note that the formatting generated by the acronym package
%% can be forced into singlespaced text by inserting "\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
%% \setlength\parskip{0pt}" into the "acronym" environment.} 

%% The default disclaimer and copyright statement is included by default.  An
%% alternate disclaimer for foreign students or others can be defined here. 
% \govtdisclaimer{Alternate Disclaimer.//See the Style Guide for more information}    

%% The default distribution is "APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE; DISTRIBUTION 
%% UNLIMITED". If a limited distribution is required, it should be entered here

  abstract = {A new technique for hyperspectral imaging called spectrotomography
	collects all available photons and relies on computer tomography
	to reconstruct the three-dimensional data cube of an object. A rotational
	spectrotomographic (RST) imager is designed with a wide-aperture,
	objective-grating camera that is rotated in steps around its optical
	axis. The full range of spatial and spectral resolution is achieved
	by the use of a stepped-focal-length (zoom) lens to illuminate the
	grating. Two-dimensional projections of the object are analyzed with
	the use of both direct Fourier methods and filter-backprojection
	algorithms. The RST imager has applications to detection of optical
	emissions where large photon throughput is required.},

  abstract = {A temporally and spatially nonscanning imaging spectrometer is described
	in terms of computedtomography concepts, specifically the central-slice
	theorem. A sequence of three transmission sinusoidalphase gratings
	rotated in 60{\textdegree} increments achieves dispersion in multiple
	directions and into multiple orders. The dispersed images of the
	system's field stop are interpreted as two-dimensional projections
	of a three-dimensional (x, y, $\lambda$) object cube. Because of
	the size of the finite focal-plane array, this imaging spectrometer
	is an example of a limited-view-angle tomographic system. The imaging
	spectrometer's point spread function is measured experimentally as
	a function of wavelength and position in the field of view. Reconstruction
	of the object cube is then achieved through the maximum-likelihood,
	expectation-maximization algorithm under the assumption of a Poisson
	likelihood law. Experimental results indicate that the instrument
	performs well in the case of broadband and narrow-band emitters.},
